Answers can be found in file txt/yaml/sh.
- If the answer is in txt file, please copy the command from file to terminal
- If the answer is in yaml file, you may apply the manifest regularly
- If the answer is in sh file, jush run the bash script.

Questions that have both bash file and yaml file, please run the bash, it will run the manifest.

Good Luck!
